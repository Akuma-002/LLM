    "note": "A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. The objects within a set are called elements. Sets are typically denoted by curly braces, and elements are listed inside. For example, if A is the set of natural numbers less than 5, it can be written as A={1,2,3,4}.",
